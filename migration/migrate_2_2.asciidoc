[[breaking_22_index_apis]]
=== Index APIs

==== Field stats API

The field stats response format has been changed for number based and date fields. The `min_value` and
`max_value` elements now return values as number and the new `min_value_as_string` and `max_value_as_string`
return the values as string.

[[breaking_22_node_stats_apis]]
=== Node Stats API

==== Adding system CPU percent to OS stats

The recent CPU usage (as a percent) has been added to the OS stats reported under the node stats API and the cat nodes
API. If you send an appropriate nodes stats request to a node running version 2.2.0 or later of Elasticsearch, the CPU
usage will be shown for any nodes in the response that are also running version 2.2.0 or later of Elasticsearch. Do
note that if you send a node stats request to a node running a version of Elasticsearch earlier than 2.2.0, the CPU
usage will not be shown for any nodes. The "cpu" field in the cat nodes API is not output by default. If you send an
appropriate cat nodes request to a node running version 2.2.0 or later of Elasticsearch, the CPU usage will be shown
for any nodes in the response that are also running version 2.2.0 or later of Elasticsearch and will be null for any
other node in the response. Do note that if you send a cat nodes request to a node running a version of Elasticsearch
earlier than 2.2.0, the CPU usage will not be shown for any nodes. Finally, the API for
org.elasticsearch.monitor.os.OsStats has an additional method `OsStats#getCpuPercent`.

[[breaking_22_packaging]]
=== Packaging

==== Default logging using systemd

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, the default logging
configuration routed standard output to /dev/null and standard error to
the journal. However, there are often critical error messages at
startup that are logged to standard output rather than standard error
and these error messages would be lost to the nether. The default has
changed to now route standard output to the journal and standard error
to inherit this setting (these are the defaults for systemd). These
settings can be modified by editing the elasticsearch.service file.

[[breaking_22_plugins]]
=== Plugins

==== Cloud AWS

Proxy settings have been deprecated and renamed:

* from `cloud.aws.proxy_host` to `cloud.aws.proxy.host`
* from `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy_host` to `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy.host`
* from `cloud.aws.s3.proxy_host` to `cloud.aws.s3.proxy.host`
* from `cloud.aws.proxy_port` to `cloud.aws.proxy.port`
* from `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy_port` to `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy.port`
* from `cloud.aws.s3.proxy_port` to `cloud.aws.s3.proxy.port`

If you are using proxy settings, update your settings as deprecated ones will be removed in next major version.
